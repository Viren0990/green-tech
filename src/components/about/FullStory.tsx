                        DMD Greentech Revive: A Journey of Resilience and Responsibility
                    </h2>

                    <p className="mb-6">
                        After completing my 12th in science, life pushed me to leave my home and hometown—not by choice, but by necessity. Severe drought and the lack of water made daily life uncertain. During that difficult time, I planted 50 coconut saplings with hope. That small act quietly taught me a lifelong lesson: nature gives back only when we protect it.
                    </p>

                    <p className="mb-6">
                        My professional journey began in Haldwani, Uttarakhand, followed by business and work in Bageshwar and Almora. These early years involved constant travel and learning. Alongside this, I worked continuously in the gold and precious metals industry, which deepened my respect for natural resources and the value hidden within materials we often overlook.
                    </p>

                    <p className="mb-6">
                        Work later took me beyond India—to the United States and 4–5 other countries. Traveling across diverse landscapes and cultures strengthened my love for nature and sustainability. The more I saw the world, the more I understood how deeply human actions affect the environment.
                    </p>

                    <p className="mb-6">
                        In 2016, I came across a report that deeply disturbed me. According to the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2016, India was ranked 141 out of 180 countries. By 2018, India's rank fell to 177, largely due to worsening air quality and poor waste management. As I studied further, one major cause stood out—unmanaged e-waste.
                    </p>

                    <p className="font-bold text-gray-900 text-xl mb-6">
                        That realization changed everything.
                    </p>

                    <p className="mb-6">
                        I began studying e-waste, recycling systems, and global best practices. I wrote a small book highlighting the urgent need for certified CFC (Collection, Facilitation & Recycling) centers in India. With my background in precious metals, I realized that waste is not the end of a product's life—it is the beginning of a circular economy.
                    </p>

                    <p className="mb-6">
                        This belief led to action. I planted 2,500 trees, not as a symbolic gesture, but as a promise—to give back more than I take. Soon after, the vision of DMD Greentech Revive was born: a mission to revive value from e-waste, protect the environment, and build a responsible, transparent, and sustainable recycling ecosystem in India.

                        This is not just a business journey. It is a journey shaped by drought, travel, learning, concern, and commitment. And this is where our green revival truly begins.
